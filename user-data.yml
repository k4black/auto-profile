publications:
  - title: "LCT-1 at SemEval-2023 Task 10: Pre-training and Multi-task Learning for Sexism Detection and Classification"
    venue: accepted, ACL-2023 workshop
    url: https://github.com/lct-rug-2022/edos-2023
    year: 2023
    authors: [K.Chernyshev, E.Garanina, D.bayram, Q.Zheng]
    abstract: >
      Misogyny and sexism are growing problems in social media. 
      Advances have been made in online sexism detection but the systems are often uninterpretable. 
      SemEval-2023 Task 10 on Explainable Detection of Online Sexism aims at increasing 
      explainability of the sexism detection, and our team participated in all the proposed subtasks. 
      Our system is based on further domain-adaptive pre-training (Gururangan et al., 2020). 
      Building on the Transformer-based models with the domain adaptation, we compare fine-tuning 
      with multi-task learning and show that each subtask requires a different system configuration.
      In our experiments, multi-task learning performs on par with standard fine-tuning for sexism 
      detection and noticeably better for coarse-grained sexism classification, while fine-tuning is 
      preferable for fine-grained classification.
  - title: "U-MATH: A University-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Skills in LLMs"
    venue: accepted, ACL-2025 workshop
    url: https://toloka.ai/math-benchmark
    year: 2025
    authors: [K.Chernyshev, V.Polshkov, E.Artemova, A.Myasnikov, V.Stepanov, A.Miasnikov, S.Tilga]
    abstract: >
      The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.
      To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release μ-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.
      The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on μ-MATH.
